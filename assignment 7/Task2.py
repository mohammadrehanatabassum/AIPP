    ERROR IDENTIFIED:
    - Original code: n += 1 (incrementing)
    - Problem: Since condition is n >= 0, incrementing n makes it
      grow forever, causing infinite loop
    
    FIX APPLIED:
    - Changed to: n -= 1 (decrementing)
    - Now n decreases each iteration until it becomes negative
    - Loop terminates when n < 0
    
    EXAMPLE:
    - Input: n = 5
    - Output: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 (then stops)
